# Intro to Inferential Statistics

Inferential statistics allows us to draw conclusions from data that might not be immediately obvious. This course focuses on enhancing your ability to develop hypotheses and use common tests such as t-tests, ANOVA tests, and regression to validate your claims.

## Project - Investigate Haberman's Post Breast Cancer surgery Patient Survival Data Set

I developed 3 hypotheses to investigate factors affecting patients survival rate after surgery.  These factors are:

- Patients age at time of surgery
- Patients survival rate difference among 40s to 70s
- Number of positive auxillary nodes detected

I used t-tests, chi-square test to retain or reject null hypotheses.
